## Deployment

1. Locally run `npm run release`
2. Choose a new semver version number
3. _In the background: the `package.json` version will be bumped and committed, a new Git tag created, and the GitHub Releases page will open._
4. Create a GitHub Release entry (opens in brower automatically)
5. Done!
